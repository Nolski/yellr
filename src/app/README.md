source code for the Yellr app

Do not edit anything in the 'www/' folder. It is built dynamically. Any changes you make there will be lost.

WARNING
index.html IS AND MUST BE MANUALLY EDITED
It is copied directly to the 'www' folder, which is copied to the application 'www' folder
index.html contains Handlebar templates that must be manually implemented

But why is there a jade file in there?
It's there so you can write markup, styles, and JS in the browser.
Once everything is set you can test it on the phone.
Which one is easier? Debugging in the browser or debugging on the phone?

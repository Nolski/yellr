# yellr source

citizen engagement/journalism app and website


### Start-up
1. have node.js installed
2. run 'npm install' from the 'src' folder
3. run 'grunt' to build the project

During development use 'grunt watch' to rebuild the project after file changes.


### Info

Grunt will build the project files into a build/ folder at the top directory.

build/ holds a single html file that has all the mark-up and styles applied. That html file is then cut up and used accordingly for templates used by the website and app.

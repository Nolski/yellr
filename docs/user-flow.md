Use Case 1
----------------------------
John is 19 and very comfortable with technology. He starts using Yellr after hearing about it during his senior year at East High in Rochester. He has submitted content to Yellr and had his video piece aired on TV, something his entire family congradulated him for. He has been working on a small documentary piece about his grandparents and their experiences in Rochester. He submits his video as a work-in-progress so that he can receive feedback. He uses the web app to submit work. He uses his computer to edit video footrage so the web app is more convenient for him. He often checks the yellr rochester feed to see what's going on in the city. This is his source of news. He follows some of his friends who produce music and share it with the city. He hears about concerts and other acts through yellr.

One day on his walk home from a friend's house he happens to have a police chase end a block away from where he was standing. He runs over to find a car smashed into a pole and 3 police officers getting of their cars. He pulls out his smart phone and opens up the Yellr app.

John opens the app and immediately starts taking pictures of the scene. As the police reach the suspect's car they start tearing him out of the car violently. John switches to start recoring video. One of the officers notices him recording the situation and starts heading in his direction. John stops recording and submits the content as soon as he can. Just as the officer reached him, John felt his phone vibrate, a confirmation that his submission made it through. Just as the officer leaves to return to the scene, John gets a message saying his submission has been viewed by someone at WDKX. A few seconds later he sees that someone at WXXI has viewed his work.

Later that night John was watching the news he sees some of his video footage on the police chase report. Initially he was upset that he was not creditted with his name, since the app always defaults to anonymous posting, but he accepted it once he realized it was best to avoid any connection to the incident since the officer could see the footage and try to find out who submitted it.

The next day he opens the app and sees he has a notification. One he's never seen before. He has a mesage direct from WXXI about partnering with them to submit content from his neighborhood on a regular basis. He meets with them and eventually joins full-time after finishing college.

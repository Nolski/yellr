# Assignments and Collections

Understanding the relationship between Assignments and Collections.

- Assignment - question text, deadline
- Collection - group of posts submitted by users


Collections are typically associated with an Assignment.
However, this is not always the case. A user (users in the context of this article referes to the "Admin" users) can create a collection for just about anything. Collections are essentially folders. They allow you to group similar content together.

Collections are the bridge between creating an assignment and a published report.
